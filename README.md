# WebGL & THREE.js, shaders and react-three-fiber Workshop

Here are some starter kits for WebGL & THREE.js, shaders and react-three-fiber for use in our demo projects

# Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- ???
- Profit!

The examples are static HTML/JS and create-react-app, the individual instructions are below

## WebGL & THREE.js Starter

This is a basic THREE.js starter project, it can be run by executing the following:

```
cd ./01-webgl-three

// This will spin up a local server at http://localhost:5000
npx serve

// Edit code in the index.js file
```

## Shaders

This is slightly different to the first project in that it uses raw WebGL to load and render shaders - it's more advanced than the first project, and should be used in conjunction with [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/):

```
cd ./02-shaders

// This will spin up a local server at http://localhost:5000
npx serve

// Edit code in the index.js file
```

## react-three-fiber

This is another different project that uses `react-three-fiber` and `react-spring` for animations. It is built using `create-react-app` so it is executed slightly differently:

```
cd ./03-react-three-fiber

// Install dependencies and start the project, this will spin up a local server at http://localhost:3000
yarn && yarn start

// Edit code in the ./src/App.js file
```

All of these are to be used in conjunction with tutorials, or just if you want to play around!
